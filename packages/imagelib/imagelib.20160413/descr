imagelib is a library to open and save image for OCaml with almost no
external dependencies (only ocamlzip, but it is planned to reimplement
zlib in OCaml). Currently the supported format are

- png
- ppm suit (pbm, ppm, pgm, ...)
- jpg (currently only the image size)
- gif (currently only the image size)
- xcf (currently only the image size)
- other formats using the convert binary from imagemagick if available.
