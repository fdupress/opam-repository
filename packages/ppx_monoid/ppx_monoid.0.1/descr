A syntax extension for OCaml to make building values of monoids
easier. Assumes the existence of two operations in scope for some type
`t`:

    empty : t
    (^^)  : t -> t -> t

`ppx-monoid`, triggered by the PPX extension point `monoid`,
reinterprets the semicolon `;` to mean the monoid operation `^^` and
the unit expression `()` to mean `empty`.
